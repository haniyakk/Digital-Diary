## DISCLAIMER  
  
This project is a **non-commercial academic model**, created for learning and demonstration purposes only. It is just my **2nd semester's project**, built as part of my coursework. It is not intended for production or commercial use.  

üóÇÔ∏è Note: The database connection in this project currently uses an **absolute file path**.  
This means you‚Äôll need to update the path in the code to match your own system setup.  
(e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\DigitalDiary\db.accdb`)  

For easier portability in future, switching to a **relative path** is recommended.
